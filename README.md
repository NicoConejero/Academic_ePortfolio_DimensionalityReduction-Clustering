## Applying dimensionality reduction on the Auto-mpg dataset and segmenting bank customers
**Course Data Analysis & Visualization**

- The first part of this project involves exploring the Auto-mpg dataset by applying dimensionality reduction techniques and visualizing the data in lower dimensions to extract insights. The second part involves segmenting a bank's customers to help the bank upgrade the service delivery model and ensure that customers' queries are resolved faster.

**Skills and Tools**

PCA, t-sne, Clustering


## PCA and t-SNE Project: Auto MPG

**Objective**

- The objective of this problem is to explore the data, reduce the number of features by using dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA and t-SNE, and extract meaningful insights.

**Dataset**

There are 8 variables in the data:

- mpg: miles per gallon
- cyl: number of cylinders
- disp: engine displacement (cu. inches) or engine size
- hp: horsepower
- wt: vehicle weight (lbs.)
- acc: time taken to accelerate from 0 to 60 mph (sec.)
- yr: model year
- car name: car model name

## Unsupervised Learning Project: AllLife Bank Customer Segmentation

**Context**

- AllLife Bank wants to focus on its credit card customer base in the next financial year. They have been advised by their marketing research team, that the penetration in the market can be improved. Based on this input, the marketing team proposes to run personalized campaigns to target new customers as well as upsell to existing customers. Another insight from the market research was that the customers perceive the support services of the bank poorly. Based on this, the operations team wants to upgrade the service delivery model, to ensure that customers' queries are resolved faster. The head of marketing and the head of delivery, both decide to reach out to the Data Science team for help.

**Objective**

- Identify different segments in the existing customer base, taking into account their spending patterns as well as past interactions with the bank.

**About the data**

- Data is available on customers of the bank with their credit limit, the total number of credit cards the customer has, and different channels through which the customer has contacted the bank for any queries. These different channels include visiting the bank, online, and through a call center.

- Sl_no - Customer Serial Number
- Customer Key - Customer identification
- Avg_Credit_Limit - Average credit limit (currency is not specified, you can make an assumption around this)
- Total_Credit_Cards - Total number of credit cards
- Total_visits_bank - Total bank visits
- Total_visits_online - Total online visits
- Total_calls_made - Total calls made
